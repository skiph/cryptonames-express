# CryptoNames

This is an example project using [CriticalBlue](http://criticalblue.com]'s [Approov](http://www.approov.io) mobile API protection.

The API is specified using [swagger](http://swagger.io).

The backend is implemented with node.js express.

The frontend is implemented as an Android application.

Note: if following this example during an [Approov trial](https://www.approov.io/index.html#pricing), the Base64 encoded secret should be stored in `express-server/.approov-token-secret`. This file is not stored in the git repo.
